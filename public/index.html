  <h1>Hello Fearless</h1>
  <br>
  <p> So my day to day use of javascript is pretty much none. I have used some css
    and html in a few R shiny projects and I've played with some javascript code on
    my own time here and there (some examples of this exist on <a href="https://github.com/ShyGuyPy">my github page</a>).</p>

<p>Pressing this button will add to the count and create an alert showing how many times it has been pressed</p>
  <!--this calls the app.js javascript file that lives in the same directory
and is handling all the logic -->
  <script src="functions.js"></script>

  <br>
  <div>
    <!-- button will live here-->
    <button class="luke_btn" onclick="clicked()">Press to Count</button>
  </div>

</body>
</html>
