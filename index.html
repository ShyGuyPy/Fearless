  <h1>Hello Fearless</h1>
  <p> So my day to day use of javascript is pretty much none. I have used some css
    and html in a few R shiny projects and I'v played with some javascript code on
    my own time here and there(some exampels of this exist on my github page).</p>

  <!--this calls the app.js javascript file that lives in the same directory
and is handling all the logic -->
  <script src="app.js"></script>

  <div>
    <!-- button will live here-->
  <div>

</body>
</html>
